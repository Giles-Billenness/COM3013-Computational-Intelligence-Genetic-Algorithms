# COM3013 Computational Intelligence - Genetic Algorithms

Coursework created for the COM3013 Computational Intelligence module during my Computer Science BSc at Surrey University. Completed Year 3 Winter 2021.

The first part of this project was to solve a multi-objective optimisation problem using the elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) with our implementation. 

Then, using this genetic algorithm for training a feed-forward multi-layer perceptron network to approximate a function. 

This project was done in python using the Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms in Python (DEAP) framework. 

During this project, I developed my knowledge and ability to use a range of machine learning paradigms to solve a problem.
